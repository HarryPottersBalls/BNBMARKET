## Frequency of Reviews
- Quarterly Comprehensive Security Audit
- Monthly Rapid Security Assessment
- Continuous Automated Monitoring

## Review Stages

### 1. Preliminary Threat Assessment
- Review recent security logs
- Analyze anomaly detection reports
- Assess global risk indicators

#### Checklist:
- [ ] Review security event logs
- [ ] Analyze market manipulation patterns
- [ ] Check user activity risk scores
- [ ] Validate compliance with regulatory requirements

### 2. Infrastructure Security Evaluation
- Network configuration review
- Access control mechanisms
- Encryption standards
- Key management practices

#### Checklist:
- [ ] Validate SSL/TLS configurations
- [ ] Review firewall and network segmentation
- [ ] Audit access control lists (ACLs)
- [ ] Verify encryption key rotation policies

### 3. Smart Contract and Blockchain Security
- Code vulnerability scanning
- Formal verification of smart contract logic
- Review of transaction validation mechanisms

#### Checklist:
- [ ] Static code analysis
- [ ] Dynamic contract testing
- [ ] Replay attack prevention verification
- [ ] Gas optimization and security review

### 4. User Authentication and Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication review
- Identity verification processes
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### Checklist:
